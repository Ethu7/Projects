Plant Health is very important when it comes to setting up a hydroponics system to grow vegetables.

Given rising populations and shortages in food due to disastrous climate events, we aim to create an easy to assemble and maintain growing 

system. A crucial part of the system is the ability to quickly identify issues with the specific plant and take a course of action to nurse 

it back to health or avoid the other plants from being infected


Will integrate with Raspberry pi setup which includes humidity, pH and temperature sensors. As well as, control of the frequency of light 

and length of time light is on based on scheduler. Once we have the data from all these endpoints we can create a comprehensive deep 

learning model to have an effective and repeatable setup.
